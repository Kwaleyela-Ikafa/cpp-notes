/* 
    You have been hired as a system developer at a newly created ZCAS University.
    As part of your first assignment, you are tasked to develop a system to manage the
    operations of this University. You are told that the departments that need to be considered as part
    of the pilot project include the Admission, Accounts and Dean of students respectively.
    The admission department wants the system to be able to admit the students after capturing their names,
    nrc, address, results, student number and gender. On the other hand, the account department is concerned
    with the tuition fees, user fees, accommodation fees, transport, name and the number of student.
    The dean of students is concerned with the system allowing him to capture the studentâ€™s number,
    names, hostel name and room number. Implement this ZCAS University system by making use of objects and classes
    as learned in class. Follow the guidelines of object oriented programming as learnt in class and other requirement
    is free style.
